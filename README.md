This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier to predict heart disease presence using the heart_disease.csv dataset. The dataset includes 303 samples with 13 feature variables. The model is trained on 75% of the data and tested on 25% to evaluate its performance. The Decision Tree model achieved a training accuracy of 86.34% and a test accuracy of 77.63%. A confusion matrix and classification report provide detailed insights into the model's precision, recall, and F1-score for each class (suffered or not suffered from heart disease). The decision tree is visualized to provide an interpretable view of the model's decision-making process.
